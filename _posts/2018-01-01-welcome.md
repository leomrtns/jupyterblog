title: Welcome to the blog

You can find more information about me on the parent site ([https://leomrtns.github.io/about/](https://leomrtns.github.io/about/)).

This blog will consist mostly of technical notes, but I don't preclude an occasional rant. Hopefully I'll move some old
posts from other, defunct blogs. 
You can also find me on a mastodon server [https://scicomm.xyz/web/@leomrtns](https://scicomm.xyz/web/@leomrtns).
