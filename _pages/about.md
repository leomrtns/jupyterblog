This page is maintained by [Leonardo de Oliveira Martins](https://leomrtns.github.io). See
[https://leomrtns.github.io](https://leomrtns.github.io) for more info about me. 


The first pages were created from [Jupyter noteboooks](https://jupyter.org/) using `R`, `python`, `bash`, and `C` kernels and [ipynb website](https://stephenslab.github.io/ipynb-website).
They started as sandbox for playing with experimental code, before incorporating them into production-level software.
This website is now powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)**.
