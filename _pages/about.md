The first pages were created from [Jupyter noteboooks](https://jupyter.org/) using `R`, `python`, `bash`, and `C` kernels and [ipynb website](https://stephenslab.github.io/ipynb-website).
They started as sandbox for playing with experimental code, before incorporating them into production-level software.


This website is now powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].

[^1]:a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.
